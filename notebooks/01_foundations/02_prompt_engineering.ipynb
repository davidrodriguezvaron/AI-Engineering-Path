    "# Iterative Prompt Development\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "This notebook covers the iterative process of prompt engineering, demonstrating how to refine prompts systematically to achieve desired outputs from LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Iterative Process**: Prompt engineering is rarely perfect on the first try-it requires continuous refinement.\n",
    "2.  **Prompt Guidelines**:\n",
    "    - Be clear and specific in your instructions.\n",
    "    - Analyze why results don't match the desired output.\n",
    "    - Refine the idea and the prompt based on feedback.\n",
    "    - Repeat until you achieve the desired result.\n",
    "    - Refine prompts with a batch of examples.\n",
    "3.  **Length Control**: Use word/sentence/character limits to control output length.\n",
    "4.  **Audience Focus**: Tailor the prompt to focus on aspects relevant to the intended audience.\n",
    "5.  **Structured Output**: Request specific formats (tables, HTML, JSON) for organized information extraction.\n",
