    "# Transforming with LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use LLMs to transform text in various ways, including translation, tone adjustment, format conversion, and grammar correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "1.  **Translation**: Translate text between languages, including detecting the source language automatically.\n",
    "2.  **Universal Translator**: Process multiple messages in different languages in a loop for efficient batch translation.\n",
    "3.  **Tone Transformation**: Convert casual/slang text to formal business language and vice versa.\n",
    "4.  **Format Conversion**: Transform data between formats (e.g., Python dict/JSON to HTML tables).\n",
    "5.  **Grammar & Spelling Correction**: Proofread and correct text, including handling homonyms and common errors.\n",
    "6.  **Diff Visualization**: Use libraries like `redlines` to visualize changes between original and corrected text.\n",

       "\n",
       "I purchased this adorable panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday after she kept taking mine from my room. Contrary to popular belief, adults can also appreciate the charm of pandas. The plush toy is not only soft and cute, but my daughter carries it everywhere with her.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, upon closer inspection, I noticed that one of the ears is slightly lower than the other, which seems to be an unintentional design flaw. Additionally, I found the size of the plush toy to be smaller than expected given its price point. I believe there are larger options available for the same cost.\n",
       "\n",
       "Despite these minor drawbacks, I was pleasantly surprised when the plush toy arrived a day earlier than anticipated. This allowed me to enjoy playing with it myself before presenting it to my daughter. Overall, while there are some room for improvements, the quality and cuteness of the panda plush toy make it a worthwhile purchase for any panda enthusiast, regardless of age."
