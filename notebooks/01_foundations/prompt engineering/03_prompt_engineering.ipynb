    "**Summary**\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use LLMs to summarize and extract key information from text, such as product reviews, for different audiences and purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "1.  **Length Control**: Use word, sentence, or character limits to control summary length.\n",
    "2.  **Audience-Focused Summaries**: Tailor summaries for specific departments or audiences (e.g., Shipping, Pricing).\n",
    "3.  **Extract vs. Summarize**: When summaries include unrelated information, use \"extract\" instead of \"summarize\" for more precise results.\n",
    "5.  **Structured Output**: Format output consistently for easier downstream processing.\n",
