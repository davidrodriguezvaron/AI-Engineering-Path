    "This notebook demonstrates how to use LLMs to infer information from text, including sentiment analysis, emotion detection, information extraction, and topic identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sentiment Analysis**: Extract positive/negative sentiment from reviews or text.\n",
    "2.  **Emotion Detection**: Identify specific emotions (happy, satisfied, angry, etc.) expressed in text.\n",
    "3.  **Information Extraction**: Pull out specific details like product names, brands, or entities in structured formats (JSON).\n",
    "4.  **Multi-Task Inference**: Combine multiple inference tasks in a single prompt for efficiency.\n",
    "5.  **Topic Identification**: Determine what topics are discussed in a given text.\n",
    "6.  **Alert Systems**: Use topic detection to trigger alerts for specific subjects of interest.\n",
