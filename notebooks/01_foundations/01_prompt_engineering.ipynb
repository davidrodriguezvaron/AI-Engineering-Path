    "1.  **LLM Types**: Distinction between Base LLMs (next-word predictors) and Instruction-Tuned LLMs (RLHF trained).\n",
    "2.  **Principle 1: Write Clear & Specific Instructions**\n",
    "    - Use delimiters (```, \"\"\", < >) to separate context.\n",
    "    - Request structured output (JSON, HTML).\n",
    "    - Check assumptions (conditionals).\n",
    "    - Use \"Few-Shot\" prompting to guide style.\n",
    "3.  **Principle 2: Give the Model Time to Think**\n",
    "    - Break down complex tasks into steps.\n",
    "    - Instruct the model to work out its own solution before evaluating constraints.\n",
