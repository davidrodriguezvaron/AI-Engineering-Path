    "# Expanding with LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use LLMs to expand short inputs into longer, contextual content such as automated email replies, while controlling output creativity with the temperature parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "1.  **Automated Replies**: Generate professional email responses based on customer reviews and sentiment.\n",
    "2.  **Sentiment-Based Responses**: Customize replies depending on whether the sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative.\n",
    "3.  **Context Awareness**: Use specific details from the input to make generated content more relevant and personalized.\n",
    "4.  **Temperature Parameter**:\n",
    "    *   `temperature=0`: Predictable, consistent outputs (best for reliable tasks).\n",
    "    *   `temperature=0.7+`: More creative, varied outputs (best for brainstorming).\n",
    "5.  **Comparing Outputs**: Use `redlines` to visualize differences between temperature=0 and higher temperature outputs.\n",
