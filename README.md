## Project Scope

This repository serves as a central hub for mastering the technical landscape of **Applied Artificial Intelligence**.

As the industry shifts from deterministic coding to probabilistic systems, this lab documents the journey of adapting robust engineering practices to the fluid nature of AI. It covers the full lifecycle: from understanding LLM fundamentals to deploying autonomous, governed systems.

## Knowledge Domains

The repository is organized into strategic domains of AI Engineering:

| Domain                         | Description                                                                 | Key Tech             |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- |
| **01. GenAI Foundations**      | Prompt engineering, API integration, and model behavior analysis.           | OpenAI, Anthropic    |
| **02. Cognitive Architecture** | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Vector Search strategies.          | ChromaDB, Pinecone   |
| **03. Autonomous Systems**     | Agentic workflows, tool use, and multi-agent orchestration.                 | LangChain, LangGraph |
| **04. AI Governance**          | Reliability engineering, safety guardrails, and evaluation metrics (Evals). | Red Teaming, TruLens |
| **05. Edge & Optimization**    | Efficient inference and deploying models to constrained environments.       | TinyML, Optimization |

## Philosophy: "Software 3.0"

This project adopts a "Software 3.0" mindset, treating Neural Networks and LLMs as a new type of software component that requires:

1.  **Observability:** Understanding why the model acts the way it does.
2.  **Determinism:** Forcing structure onto probabilistic outputs.
3.  **Safety:** Ensuring systems align with human intent and business logic.
