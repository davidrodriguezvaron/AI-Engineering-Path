## 🧭 Project Scope

This repository serves as a central hub for mastering the technical landscape of **Applied Artificial Intelligence**.

As the industry shifts from deterministic coding to probabilistic systems, this lab documents the journey of adapting robust engineering practices to the fluid nature of AI. It covers the full lifecycle: from understanding LLM fundamentals to deploying autonomous, governed systems.

## 🧠 Knowledge Domains

The repository is organized into strategic domains of AI Engineering. Each domain focuses on a specific set of skills and technologies:

| Domain                         | Description                                                           | Key Technologies                     |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **01. GenAI Foundations**      | Prompt engineering, API integration, and model behavior analysis.     | `OpenAI`, `Anthropic`, `HuggingFace` |
| **02. Cognitive Architecture** | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Vector Search strategies.    | `ChromaDB`, `Pinecone`, `LlamaIndex` |
| **03. Autonomous Systems**     | Agentic workflows, tool use, and multi-agent orchestration.           | `LangChain`, `LangGraph`, `AutoGen`  |
| **04. AI Governance**          | Reliability engineering, safety guardrails, and evaluation metrics.   | `TruLens`, `Guardrails AI`, `Arize`  |
| **05. Edge & Optimization**    | Efficient inference and deploying models to constrained environments. | `TinyML`, `ONNX`, `Quantization`     |

## 🏗️ Philosophy: "Software 3.0"

This project adopts a "Software 3.0" mindset, treating Neural Networks and LLMs as a new type of software component that requires:

- 🔭 **Observability**: Understanding _why_ the model acts the way it does.
- 🎯 **Determinism**: Forcing structure onto probabilistic outputs.
- 🛡️ **Safety**: Ensuring systems align with human intent and business logic.
